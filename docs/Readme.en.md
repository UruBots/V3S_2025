## üìù Project Description

The VSSS (Very Small Size Soccer) category is an autonomous robotics competition where teams with up to 6 robots (each with a maximum diameter of 7.5 cm and height of 15 cm) compete on a 1.5 m √ó 1.3 m field. The robots are controlled by computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms, making real-time decisions based on images captured by an overhead camera.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware

VSSS robots are small, autonomous, and designed to operate with high precision in a compact space. The hardware system consists of:

- **Structure**: compact chassis (up to 7.5 cm diameter, 15 cm height), lightweight and durable, usually 3D printed.

- **Locomotion**: DC motors with encoders, using small, narrow wheels for movement.

- **Control**: an embedded board (Arduino, ESP32) that interprets radio commands and controls the motors in real time.

- **Communication**: radio module (typically 2.4 GHz) to receive commands from the central computer.

- **Additional Electronics**: motor drivers (H-Bridge), sensors, and batteries for power.

## üß† Software

In the VSSS category, the system is divided into two main components: computer vision and robot control, typically developed in different programming languages to leverage their strengths.

- **Python** is used for the computer vision part, as it simplifies the use of libraries like **OpenCV** to process the overhead camera feed, detect the ball and robots, and generate real-time coordinates.

- **C++** is used for robot control, offering better performance and precision when sending movement commands and executing decision-making algorithms.
